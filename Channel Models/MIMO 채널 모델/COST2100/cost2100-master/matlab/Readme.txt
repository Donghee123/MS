The updated version 3.1 is implemented by Sara Gunnarsson and Jose 
Flordelis, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. Massive MIMO scenario 
Indoor_CloselySpacedUser_2_6GHz has been added, together with some 
modifications to the VLA and MPC gain function extensions for Massive MIMO. 
Additionally, bug fixes and speed optimizations are also included.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
The updated version 3.0 is implemented by Sara Gunnarsson and Jose 
Flordelis, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. Massive MIMO extensions are now 
fully backwards compatible, and the four scenarios (IndoorHall_5GHz, 
SemiUrban_300MHz, SemiUrban_VLA_2_6GHz, SemiUrban_CloselySpacedUser_2_6GHz) 
can be run. Some bug fixes and code restructuring have also been done.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
The Massive MIMO-extended version was implemented by Xiang Gao, 
Lund University, Sweden, and was partly supported by the Seventh Framework 
Programme (FP7) of the European Union under grant agreement no. 619086 
(MAMMOET). Two new scenarios are implemented:
SemiUrban_CloselySpacedUser_2_6GHz: both NLOS and LOS as well as both single and 
multiple link MIMO simulations are supported.
SemiUrban_VLA_2_6GHz: both NLOS and LOS as well as both single and multiple link 
MIMO simulations are supported.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
The updated version 2.3.5 is implemented by Meifang Zhu, Lund University, Sweden.
The get_H and get_dipole_G have been updated

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
The updated version 2.3.4 is implemented by Meifang Zhu, Lund University, Sweden.
The update_chan has been updated

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
The updated version 2.3.3 is implemented by Meifang Zhu, Lund University, Sweden.
Two scenarios are implemented so far:
SemiUrban_300MHz: both NLOS and LOS single link MIMO simulations 
are supported. For outdoor LOS multiple link MIMO simulation is supported as well. 
IndoorHall_5GHz: OLOS single link MIMO simulation is supported.

The script "demo_model.m" provides an example for testing the COST 2100 model. It selects network, 
link, antenna, band and scenario and initiates the simulation.

The output of demo_model.m is a channel function, with size dependent on the parameter choice and setup: 

1) SISO_omni: Transfer function for SISO omni-directional antenna
create_IR_omni: users have to set up the frequency separation, delta_f
 
2) MIMO_omni: Transfer function for MIMO omini-directional antenna
 create_IR_omni_MIMO: users have to set up the frequency separation, delta_f.
 Only 2 by 2 MIMO system is implemented.
 
3) MIMO_dipole: Transfer function for a theoretical antenna response for 
 any size of lambda/2-spaced linear dipole antenna arrays. An Ntx-by-Nrx theoretical 
 antenna array response is generated and the correponding 
 channel transfer function is simulated.
 
4) MIMO_measured: Transfer function for any measured MIMO antenna response
 get_H: users have to provide the full antenna response at the BS and 
 MS sides, and also the rotation of the antenna arrays. The antenna 
 response mat file have to be the same format as 'antSample.mat' file.

5) MIMO_Cyl_patch: Transfer function for a synthetic pattern of a cylindrical array 
 with 128 antennas.
 get_IR_Cyl_patch: users have to set up the frequency separation, delta_f, as well as
 provide the full antennas response at the BS and MS sides. The antennas response mat 
 file have to be the same format as the 'BS_Cyl_AntPattern.mat' and 'MS_AntPattern_User.mat' 
 files.

6) MIMO_VLA_omni: Transfer function for a physically large array with 128 omni-directional 
 antennas, with lambda/2 inter-element separation, and MS with omni-directional antenna.
 create_IR_omni_MIMO_VLA: users have to set up the frequency separation, delta_f
